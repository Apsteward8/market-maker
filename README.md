## Understanding the Strategy

### Why Copy Pinnacle?
- **Sharpest Book**: Pinnacle is widely considered the most efficient sportsbook
- **Professional Action**: They welcome professional bettors, creating efficient lines
- **No Restrictions**: Unlike other books, Pinnacle doesn't limit winning players

### Market Making Logic
```
When Pinnacle offers: Djokovic -110, Nadal +100

We place on ProphetX:
- Bet: Djokovic +110 for $100 ‚Üí Offers -110 to other users
- Bet: Nadal -100 for $100 ‚Üí Offers +100 to other users

Result: ProphetX users see the same odds as Pinnacle
```

### Profit Sources
1. **Spread Capture** - When our bets get matched, we profit from bid-ask spreads
2. **Information Edge** - We have faster access to sharp pricing than most ProphetX users
3. **Market Making Premium** - Users pay slightly more for immediate liquidity

### Risk Management
- **Position Limits** - Never risk more than configured maximums
- **Time Limits** - Stop making markets close to event start
- **Odds Monitoring** - Continuous updates prevent stale pricing

## Safety and Risk Considerations

### Start Small and Safe
1. **Use Dry Run Mode** - Test extensively before going live
2. **Small Liquidity** - Start with $25-50 per market side
3. **Limited Events** - Begin with 5-10 events max
4. **Monitor Closely** - Watch for unexpected behavior

### Risk Factors
- **Execution Risk** - ProphetX outages or API issues
- **Odds Delay** - Our prices may lag behind market movements
- **Correlation Risk** - Multiple markets can move against us simultaneously
- **Platform Risk** - ProphetX-specific risks and limitations

### Best Practices
- Monitor total exposure constantly
- Set conservative position limits initially
- Test with sandbox environment extensively
- Have manual override procedures
- Keep detailed logs and performance records

## API Credit Management

With 15M monthly credits on The Odds API:

### Usage Calculation
- **30 events** √ó **24 hours** √ó **60 requests/hour** √ó **3 markets** = **129,600 credits/day**
- **Monthly usage**: ~3.9M credits (26% of limit)

### Optimization Tips
- Focus on higher-value tournaments
- Increase polling interval during off-peak hours
- Use event filtering to reduce unnecessary requests
- Monitor usage via `/markets/api-usage` endpoint

## Monitoring and Performance

### Key Metrics to Watch
- **Total Exposure** - Current risk across all positions
- **Success Rate** - Percentage of successful market updates
- **API Usage** - Credits consumed vs. available
- **Match Rate** - How often our bets get matched

### Dashboard Access
The FastAPI docs interface provides a complete dashboard for:
- Starting/stopping the system
- Monitoring current positions
- Viewing performance statistics
- Managing configuration

## Development and Testing

### Running Tests
```bash
# Install test dependencies
pip install pytest pytest-asyncio httpx

# Run tests
pytest
```

### Local Development
```bash
# Run with auto-reload for development
uvicorn main:app --reload --log-level debug

# Access detailed logs
tail -f logs/market_maker.log
```

### Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Tests** - Test individual components
2. **Integration Tests** - Test API integrations  
3. **Dry Run Testing** - Full system test without real bets
4. **Paper Trading** - Track theoretical performance

## Production Deployment

### Environment Setup
- Use production ProphetX credentials
- Set `DRY_RUN_MODE=false` only when ready
- Configure appropriate logging and monitoring
- Set up database backups

### Monitoring
- Monitor API error rates and response times
- Track position P&L and exposure
- Set up alerts for risk limit breaches
- Log all bet placements and outcomes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **API Rate Limits** - Increase polling intervals or reduce events
- **Stale Odds** - Check The Odds API connectivity
- **ProphetX Errors** - Verify credentials and sandbox settings
- **High Exposure** - Reduce position sizes or event count

### Getting Help
1. Check the logs in `/logs/` directory
2. Use `/markets/status` endpoint for system diagnostics
3. Review API usage with `/markets/api-usage`
4. Test individual components with dry run mode
